## About

This repository contains guides with not only a simple installation option, but also advanced security settings that are highly recommended for mainnet validators.

By these documentations we will setup **server security**. After that, for Cosmos SDK apps we will run node with **Sentry Node Architecture** for DDoS mitigation. And will make a validator protection from double signing incident by **tmkms**. In addition, it is recommended to use **Monitoring** to monitor all your servers as validator, sentry nodes, tmkms server etc. Also, for more conviniate way of bynary upgrading - you can use **Cosmovisor**.

Another important topic for Cosmos Hub networks is ibc relayer - we will walk through the installation of **Hermes IBC relayer**.

## Example
Below is a schematic example of what your customized architecture of Cosmos SDK apps might look like.
